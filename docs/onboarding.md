# Onboarding

This folder quickly briefs about how to use the Azure ML to:

- Visualize data
- Submit a training job to a gpu-cluster

## Visualization
In the [data_visualization.ipynb](https://dev.azure.com/cgmwhh/ChildGrowthMonitor/_git/cgm-ml-service?path=%2Fonboarding%2Fdata_visualisation.ipynb&version=GBonboarding) notebook,  

1. Access the azure ML Workspace
1. Access a dataset and mount it on your machine
1. Plot some images of the data

## Training a network
In [Onboarding.ipynb](https://dev.azure.com/cgmwhh/ChildGrowthMonitor/_git/cgm-ml-service?path=%2Fonboarding%2FOnboarding.ipynb&version=GBonboarding) notebook,

1. Access your azure ML Workspace
1. Access a dataset and mount it on your machine
1. Perform a simple classification training job by submitting the job to the cpu-cluster/gpu-cluster
