# Child Growth Monitor Machine Learning

[Child Growth Monitor (CGM)](https://childgrowthmonitor.org) is a
game-changing app to detect malnutrition. If you have questions about the project, reach out to `info@childgrowthmonitor.org`.

This is the Machine Learnine repository associated with the CGM project.

## Introduction

This project uses machine learning to identify malnutrition from 3D scans of children under 5 years of age. This [one-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2doV43jdwg) explains.

## Getting started

### Requirements

Our development environment is [Microsoft Azure ML](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/#security)

You will need:
* Python 3
* TensorFlow version 2
* other libraries

To install, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For installing point cloud libraries, refer to
[README_installation_details_pcl.md](README_installation_details_pcl.md).

### Dataset access

If you have access to scan data, you can use: `src/data_utils` to understand and visualize the data.

Data access is provided on as-needed basis following signature of the Welthungerhilfe Data Privacy & Commitment to
Maintain Data Secrecy Agreement. If you need data access (e.g. to train your machine learning models),
please contact [Markus Matiaschek](mailto:info@childgrowthmonitor.org) for details.
