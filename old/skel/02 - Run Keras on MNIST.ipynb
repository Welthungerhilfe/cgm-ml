    "When it comes to Deep Learning there are many viable framework-options. One is Keras (https://keras.io), which we currently use most. Note that we do not restrict ourselves to Keras-only. Me might use other frameworks in the future. Nevertheless Keras is excellent when it comes to rapid prototyping. And it is way easier to understand than for example TensorFlow and PyTorch.\n",

    "MNIST (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) is a database of handwritten digits. It poses a supervised learning problem. This means that you have labelled data. In our case pictures of the mentioned digits plus the actual digit as a number. MNIST is the Hello-World of Machine Learning."
